# Insights from Podcast Reviews

## Project Overview
This project navigates through the vast terrain of podcast reviews, aiming to extract meaningful insights using a blend of statistical analysis, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). By harnessing the power of SQL for data manipulation and Python for analysis, we delve into podcast categories, ratings, and reviewer sentiments to uncover patterns and trends that could inform podcast creators and marketers alike.

## Objectives
- To perform comprehensive EDA on the Podcast Reviews Dataset.
- To apply statistical inference to test hypotheses related to podcast ratings and categories.
- To visualize data findings using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Google Data Studio for interactive exploration.
- To offer insights that could help improve podcast content and engagement strategies.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the Podcast Reviews Dataset, which encompasses a wide range of podcasts, their categories, ratings, and individual reviews. [Download the data here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/podcastreviews/versions/28).

## Analysis Highlights
- EDA revealed predominant categories and their distribution across ratings.
- Statistical tests assessed the impact of categories on ratings, employing t-tests and z-tests to compare means and proportions.
- A Google Data Studio dashboard was created to dynamically explore podcast reviews over time.

## Key Findings
- Certain podcast categories consistently yield higher ratings, indicating niche preferences.
- No significant correlation was found between the length of reviews and ratings, suggesting content quality as a primary influencer.
- The dashboard highlights trends and outliers, providing a real-time tool for market analysis.

## Future Directions
- Incorporating NLP to analyze review sentiments and themes.
- Exploring listener engagement patterns for targeted content creation.
- Enhancing the dashboard with more interactive features and real-time data updates.
